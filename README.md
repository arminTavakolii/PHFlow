# PHFlow framework

Welcome to PHFlow, a powerful framework with features such as authentication, access to config as a dot array, ORM with CRUD operations, soft delete and relations support. It also includes useful helper functions, request validation with practical rules, a routing system with reservation, a session management section, view loading with extends, yields, and sections, an AppServiceProvider, migrations section, and an API section currently under development. The framework is highly inspired by Laravel and a test project has been implemented to validate its functionalities. If possible, we will also provide this test project for your reference.

## Installation

To install this framework, simply follow these steps:

1. Copy the core files into the root directory of your project.
2. Place your controllers, except for the index page controller, in the `app/Http/Controllers` directory.
3. Put your models in the `app` directory.
4. Store your views in the `resources/views` directory with the `.blade.php` extension.
5. Add your custom helpers in a file named `helpers.php` located in the `app/Http` directory.

Make sure to configure your routes, controllers, models, and views according to your requirements and the documentation guidelines.

## Documentation

Soon, we will upload the necessary documentation for working with this framework on our dedicated website.

## Project Test

A test project has been created to evaluate the performance and capabilities of the framework. If possible, we will also make this project available for you.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to the development and improvement of this framework. We also share multiple projects with different complexity levels that utilize this framework.

## Local Development

To run the project locally on `localhost:8000`, follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal and navigate to the `public` directory of the project.
2. Run the command `php -S localhost:8000` to start the project.

## Future Development

Our future goal is to develop a powerful e-commerce project using this framework to test its capabilities, performance, and security.

## Additional Features

We have plans to add more features to this framework, including further optimizations and enhanced security measures.
